    <h2>Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)</h2>

    <p>A <strong>strongly connected component (SCC)</strong> is defined as a subset of vertices in which there exists a path from each vertex to another vertex.</p>
        
    <p>What are the SCCs of the above graph?</p>
        
    <p>Collapse each SCC you found into a meta-node, so that you end up with a graph of the SCC meta-nodes. Draw this graph below, and submit.</p>

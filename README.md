# **A Direct Manipulation User Interface for Constructing Autogradable Graphs**

## **Overview**
This project introduces **pl-graph-constructor**, a direct manipulation tool designed for **PrairieLearn** that enables students to construct and edit graphs using a **drag-and-drop interface**.  
The tool automatically converts the student-created graphs into **DOT-language format** or **Python dictionary** to support **autograding, instant feedback, and iterative resubmission** within PrarieLearn.

It addresses common challenges in graph-based assessments, such as manual grading errors and limited scalability, by providing a more accurate, engaging, and automatable environment for both students and instructors.

### **Running the Project with Docker**

To launch **PrairieLearn** and the **Graph Constructor tool** using Docker:

### **1. Clone this repository**  

### **2. Pull the PrairieLearn Docker image**  
```bash
docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 prairielearn/prairielearn
```
### **3. Run the PrairieLearn container**  
```bash
docker run --platform linux/amd64 -it --rm \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v "$(pwd):/course" \
  -e AUTH_MODE=none \
  prairielearn/prairielearn:latest
```
### **3. Access PrairieLearn locally**  
Wait for <ins>http://localhost:3000</ins> to appear and click on it.

### **4. Load From Disk**  
Click "Load From Disk" in the top right corner and wait for it to run.

### **5. You are all set!**  
Try some of the example questions. Try changing their XML, or create your own questions (more information in the elements/pl-interactive-graph folder's README.md)
